## About AA Intergroup

We are a committee of volunteers made up of representatives from the A.A. groups
all over the local area and are directly responsible to those groups
we serve. We encourage mutual support and cooperation among A.A. groups.

Come join our group of men and women volunteers to help serve your community and
be a part of planning fun and exciting events throughout the year!

## What is an Intergroup?

"An Intergroup (sometimes referred to as a central office) is an A.A. service
office established to help carry the message of Alcoholics Anonymous to a certain
geographical area. It is a partnership among groups in a community--just as A.A.
groups themselves are partnerships of individuals. An intergroup is established
to carry out certain functions common to all the groups--functions which are best
handled by a centralized office--and it is usually maintained, supervised, and
supported by these groups in their general interest. It exists to aid the groups
in their common purpose of carrying the A.A. message to the alcoholic who still
suffers." --- Reprinted from A.A. Guidelines, Central or Intergroup Offices with
