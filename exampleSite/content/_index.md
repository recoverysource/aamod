**What is Alcoholics Anonymous?**

Alcoholics AnonymousÂ® is a fellowship of men and women who share their
experience, strength and hope with each other that they may solve their common
problem and help others to recover from alcoholism.

- The only requirement for membership is a desire to stop drinking. There are no dues
  or fees for AA membership; we are self-supporting through our own contributions.
- A.A. is not allied with any sect, denomination, politics, organization or institution;
  does not wish to engage in any controversy; neither endorses nor opposes any causes.
- Our primary purpose is to stay sober and help other alcoholics to achieve sobriety.
